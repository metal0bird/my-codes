. functional vs logic programming 
. prolog programming 
. in logic, computation is not sequential 

syntax
relation(object1, object2....)
always use small case letters
:- means if
; means or 
, means and 

eg. tom is a cat
1. cat - relation , tom becomes object, cat(tom).   {after each fact u need toput " . ", its in syntax
2. tom,cat - object, animal(tom,cat)

eg. bitches love to eat dick
1. loves_to_eat(bitches,dick), sometimes this might also give dick loves to eat bitches, because computer is dumb, depends on what we assume to be the dominant object 
when u give queries it might give diff results 

thats why consider then as 1st object and 2nd object and suppose one priority


eg. hair is black
1. colour(hair,black)

eg. fat bitches are lazy
1. lazy(fat bitches)
